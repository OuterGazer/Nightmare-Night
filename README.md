This game is based on the Zombie Runner section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.

My original implementations are:

- Completely different aesthetics and level design. Built up to 3 levels, the first one using unity terrain tools and the last two with meshes.
- 2 different enemy types with distinct behaviour.
- 1 boss fight at the end of the game.
- 2 diffent weapons. One of them a throwing axe that you can retrieve back from the ground.
- Implemented UI with a main menu and a pause menu.
- Implemented post processing effects that give feedback to the player when they get hit.
- Implemented healing pick-ups.
- Implemented the ability to retrieve the axe by choosing the relevant option on the pause menu. This is done to solve possible issues where the axe falls down into a place that makes it irretrievable.
- Implemented narrative through pop ups to give players direction.
- Implemented lore through 5 collectable scrolls showing the story of someone who was also on the same place at an undetermined erlier time.
